Bio-Frescobi 
============

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires other modules and libraries as specified in Makefile.PL.

Besides the Perl modules, this package also requires the following:

hmmer-2.3.2
The old NCBI blast package (ncbi-050604)
exonerate-2.2.0
fasta-35.4.7
BioPerl-1.6.1
SHA-2.01

INSTALLATION

There are manual pages generated for both the Perl modules as well as
the scripts. You will need to ensure that your MANPATH references
them.

For testing purposes, you need configure Postgres so that the user who
runs the test scripts can login to Postgres without specifying a
username or password and that the user can create databases.
